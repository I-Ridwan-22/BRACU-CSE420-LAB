We have initialized a variable to count the number of errors and set it to 0. Also initialized some global variables along with three functions where one checks if the function is declared or not, one checks if the variable is in the current scope or not and one gets the information of the variable. We have used some condition in some rules to check and detect the error of multiple declaration of function, multiple declaration of parameter, and void type variable.
